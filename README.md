  ## Credits  
### Authors  
This project was a solo venture  
### Resources  
Node docs, and the docs for all dependencies were great to reference. Bulma was wonderful as always for styling the simple HTML. As usual, thanks to StackOverflow, w3schools and MDN. My final thanks goes to my instructor, Ross Ritchey, for helping me understand the last bug that was holding up the completion of the app.
